"""Creation of one evaluation run directory.

Every artefact this tool writes goes under evaluation/runs/<timestamp>/, which
../GOALS.md requires so that input/ and output/ are never touched. Two entry points: create_run_directory is strict and refuses any name that
already exists, and allocate_run_directory is what callers use - it asks for the
timestamp, then -2, -3 and so on until the strict call succeeds. The strictness
of the first is what guarantees the second can never write into an existing run.
